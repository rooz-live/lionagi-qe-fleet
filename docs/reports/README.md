## Using These Reports

**For Contributors**: These reports show how features were implemented and verified. Use them to understand design decisions and testing approaches.

**For Users**: Skip these reports unless you're debugging or deeply interested in implementation details. See the main documentation instead.

**For Researchers**: These reports demonstrate AI-powered QE in action, showing how agents coordinate, learn, and optimize quality workflows.

## Report Format

Most reports follow this structure:
1. **Executive Summary** - High-level overview
2. **Implementation Details** - Technical specifics
3. **Verification** - Testing and validation
4. **Results** - Outcomes and metrics
5. **Next Steps** - Future improvements

## Documentation vs Reports

| Documentation (docs/) | Reports (docs/reports/) |
|----------------------|-------------------------|
| User-facing guides | Internal technical reports |
| How to use features | How features were built |
| Timeless reference | Point-in-time snapshots |
| Maintained and updated | Historical records |

## Contributing

When adding new reports:
1. Use descriptive kebab-case names (e.g., `feature-implementation.md`)
2. Include date and version in the report header
3. Follow the standard report structure
4. Link to related issues or PRs
5. Update this README with the new report
